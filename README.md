THIS IS A CHROME EXTENSION FOR YOUTUBE MUSIC !!!

FEATURES:
- Filter a playlist's songs by search (supports search for artist, album, title)
- Create queues that are made from those filtered songs
- Support for multiple filters at once (separate by comma, example: "alex g,whirr,never gonna give you up")

HOW TO USE:
- the filter button should be beside the sort sort button in your playlist view
- once a filter is set click play on one of the filtered songs (not the big one to the left that one is not sigma, the one thats on the songs)
